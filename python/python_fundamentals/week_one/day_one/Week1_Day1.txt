Edgar's Python Expectations

1) 20 minute rule - continue to use it! (recreating work environment)
    -Use the platform and other resources for 20 minutes
    -Then, ask a classmate (you're all a dev team!)
    -Then, ask publicly in [ONL] Python (you wouldn't get to bug your Senior Dev all the time)
2) Know your resources and how to ask a question
    -Platform, Google, Cohort-mates (ask someone directly)
    -Use [ONL] Python (Everyone is here :])
    -Ask quesiton publicly (so anyone can help!)
    -Screenshots are helpful
    -Pay it forward (Answer as many questions as you can)
3) Continue to be inquisitive - I want you to teach me something
4) This is harder material - have pride, not fear
5) Addressing issues in a timely manner (Falling Behind, personal issues, etc)

6) Understanding where we're headed (Platform -- full-stack example)
    -Like Web Fundamentals -- Last 2 Weeks are Extra Material. 
    -Unlike Web Fundamentals -- Required assignments will be completed by Week 6 (plan accordingly :])
7) Week 1 Goals VS ALL other weeks
    -Learn Python Syntax (how to write an if statement, how to write a for loop, etc)
    -Becoming comfy with your Terminal
    -We don't need venv to run python files. If we get used to activating it, it'll be second nature when we get to Django.
