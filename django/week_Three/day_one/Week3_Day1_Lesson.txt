missed opp --- image from Web Fundamental, to validate knowledge students could resonate with

go into request/res from django --- then, do it in Django

then compare to Django Req/Res image
--

HTTP Response is always returned from the server
    Lots of tangential deep-dives during req/res overview
    Keep this conceptual setup tight

RESTful API design is a bit much for day one of Django --- a bit much.
    Just keep going.

It is essential to walk through the full setup of a Django app 
from scratch when they are seeing Django for the first time. 

Good handling of bug --- gonna happen to everyone.
Watch comments on URLs

What is REQUEST mean in the function --- if I don't know the answer, say so.
